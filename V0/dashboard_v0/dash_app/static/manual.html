                <p>This site is a very simple visual dashboard
                that allows you to review your shopping data from Everyday Rewards
                loyalty program (previously known as Woolworths Rewards - only in Australia).
                You probably know,
                that if you opt-in, you can see all your eReceipts
                from Woolworths, BigW and BWS on the Everyday Rewards (ER) website and
                in the ER mobile app. You only can see individual
                receipts though, being unable to download
                all your data in a machine readable format - i.e. Excel.</p>
                <p>With my dashboard it is possible!</p>
                <p><small class='text-secondary'>
                  It is just a little lockdown hobby project (and my name is Eugene btw).
                  I like data and like making it accessible. Hope, you'll enjoy it.</small></p>

                <h4 class='mt-3 text-primary'>Install Chrome Extension</h4>
                <p>You will need to use specialised free Chrome Extension:
                  <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kjnoihdmllddkmfhikjlkbfcdcmghhji'>myShopData</a>.
                It is available only for Google Chrome at this stage and available from official Chrome Web Store.
                It will securely bulk-download your eReceipts for you and help to
                send this data to myShopDash in one file.</p>
                  <h4 class='mt-3 text-primary'>Use the Extension on the Everyday Rewards website</h4>
                <p>When installed, navigate to Everyday Rewards website and
                log in there. Then run the Extension by pressing the button in your
              browser's extension shelf.</p>
                <h4  class='mt-3 text-primary'>Save your data or send here</h4>
                <p>The Extension guides you through the process.
                You will be able to choose from two options: save your
              data locally as an encoded file <span class='text-secondary'>
              (for experts: it is actually a json file
              with all the information API provides)</span> or upload it
              onto myShopDash in one click. The Extension does not
              send your data to this website until you press the button,
              so you can choose to save your data securely on your computer
              without sending it to myShopDash if neccessary.</p>
              <h4  class='mt-3 text-primary'>View your data</h4>
              <p>If you choose to upload your data on myShopDash: you will be redirected onto
              your dashboard immediately. Your data will be temporarily saved
              on this server. Nobody will be able to see your data except for you.
              Your view will be accessible only from your current browser
              and only for a limited time (no longer than 36 hours and only
              until your browser window is open). </p>
              <p>myShopDash decode the data, summarise and visualise it. If you
                have never used it, you
              can see it in action in demo-mode
              <a href='/dashapp/'>here</a> (a depersonalised demonstration data
              file is used for this demo-version).</p>
              <p>From your dashboard you can download your decoded data on your computer as
              Excel file. </p>
              <h4  class='mt-3 text-primary'>Delete your data from myShopDash</h4>
              <p>You can delete your data from the server at any time by pressing
              the red button at the bottom of the page.</p>
              <p>If you navidated from the Dashboard very recently and didn't
                deleted your data, you can return back to the dashboard
                <a href='/dashapp/'>here</a> and continue your session.</p>
              <p>If you forget to delete your data, myShopDash deletes it
                automatically no later than 36 hours
                after your visit.</p>

                  <p>It is very likely that the service will not work exactly as
                    described, especially at first. I will be grateful for
                    detailed bug reports, so bugs can be fixed. You can also suggest
                    fixes directly through GitHub.</p>
                  <p>The most typical expected problem, that your eReceipts
                  are not parced/decoded properly, so they are shown
                  corrupted or break the dashboard completely. If this happens,
                  consider sending me your JSON file, downloaded directly from myShopData Extension.
                  I can guarantee confidentiality of your shopping details.</p>
                  <p>New features will be being added as we go,
                    and any suggestions are appreciated.</p>
                  <p>As myShopDash (or, rather, the browser extension) uses
                  a Woolworths' corporate program interface that is not
                  oficially documented, some issues might arise if modification
                  to the protocol are introduced by the company.
                  So if something looks broken, drop me a message.</p>
