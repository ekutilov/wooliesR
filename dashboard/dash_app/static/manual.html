                <p>This site is a very simple (for now) visual dashboard
                that allows you to review your shopping data from Everyday Rewards
                loyalty program (previously known as Woolworths Rewards - only in Australia).
                In particular,
                when you opt-in, you can see all your eReceipts after check-out
                from Woolworths, BigW and BWS on the Everyday Rewards (ER) website and
                in the ER mobile app. However, you only can click individual
                receipts, but can't download
                all your data in machine readable format - i.e. Excel.</p>
                <p>With my dashboard it might be just possible.</p>
                <p><small class='text-secondary'>
                  In fact, it is just my little lockdown project (and my name is Eugene btw).
                  I simply like data and like making it accessible.</small></p>
              <p><small class='text-secondary'>

                intended to infringe IP or data security arrangements at

              <dd class='col-9'>
                <p>You may need aggregated info about your supermarket buys
                  for different purposes:
                </p>
                <p>
                  1) You may see how, where and what you spend most of your
                  groceries expences on. Probably, want to optimise it, like
                  buying things in bulk.</p>
                <p>2) You may see prices on individual products and how they change in time.</p>
                <p>3) You may have a separate loyalty account for your
                  taxable expences and you can export you expences directly
                  to your accounting software.</p>
                <p>4) You may save your data for future analysis, as eReceipts
                  on Everyday Rewards
                  website are saved only for 14 months, and you may wish to see
                  a deeper data horizon.</p>

              <dd class='col-9'>
                <h4><strong>1. Install Chrome Extension</strong></h4>
                <p>You need to use specialised Chrome Extension: <strong>myShopData</strong>
                to download your data from your account at Everyday Rewards website.
                It will bulk-download your eReceipts for you and help to
                send this data to myShopDash in one chunk.</p>
                <p class='text-warning small m-1'>On this stage
                  the extension is not approved for Chrome Store.
                  You can download Extension code from GitHub and install it
                  as 'unpacked extension' in Developers mode in your browser.</p>
                  <p class='text-warning small m-1'>1) Download a zip file from here:
                    <a href='https://github.com/ekutilov/wooliesR/extension/distr'>github</a>
                  and unpack it.</p>
                    <p class='text-warning small m-1'>2) Open chrome extensions page: type <b>chrome://extensions</b> in url box.</p>
                      <p class='text-warning small m-1'>3) Turn on developer mode right top corner</p>
                      <p class='text-warning small m-1'>4) Click install unpacked and choose the directory where you
                      unpacked the zip file.</p>
                      <p>The Extension is available
                  for Chrome users only at this stage.</p>
                  <h4><strong>2. Use the Extension on the Everyday Rewards website</strong></h4>
                <p>When installed, navigate to Everyday Rewards website and
                log in there. Then run the Extension by pressing the button in your
              browser's extension shelf (on the right of the address line, under the jugsaw piece icon -
              the Extension's button is orange with letter r).</p>
                <h4><strong>3. Save data or send it for analysis here</strong></h4>
                <p>The Extension will guige you through the process.
                You will be able to choose from two options: save your
              data locally as a encoded file <span class='text-secondary'>
              (for experts: it is actually json file
              with all the information API provides)</span> or upload it
              onto myShopDash in one click. The Extension does not
              send your data to this website until you press the button,
              so you can choose to save your data securely on your computer
              without sending it to myShopDash.</p>
              <h4><strong>4. View your data</strong></h4>
              <p>If you choose to upload your data on myShopDash: you will be redirected onto
              your dashboard immediately. Your data will be temporarily saved
              on the server. Nobodywill be able to see your data  except for you.
              Your view will be accessible only from your current browser
              and only for a limited time (no longer than 36 hours and only
              until your browser window is open). </p>
              <p>myShopDash decode the data, summarise and visualise it. If you
                have never used it, you
              can see it in action in demo-mode
              <a href='/dashapp/'>here</a> (a depersonalised demonstration data
              file is used for the demo-version).</p>
              <p>From your dashboard you can download your decoded data on your computer as
              Excel file. </p>
              <h4><strong>4. Delete your data from myShopDash</strong></h4>
              <p>You can delete your data from the server at any time by pressing
              the red button at the bottom of the page.</p>
              <p>If you navidated from the Dashboard very recently and didn't
                deleted your data, you can return back to the dashboard
                <a href='/dashapp/'>here</a> and continue your session.</p>
              <p>If you forget to delete your data, myShopDash deletes it
                automatically no later than 36 hours
                after your visit.</p>

                  <p>It is very likely that the service will not work exactly as
                    described, especially at first. I will be grateful for
                    detailed bug reports, so bugs can be fixed. You can also suggest
                    fixes directly through GitHub.</p>
                  <p>The most typical expected problem, that your eReceipts
                  are not parced/decoded properly, so they are shown
                  corrupted or break the dashboard completely. If this happens,
                  consider sending me your JSON file, downloaded directly from myShopData Extension.
                  I can guarantee confidentiality of your shopping details.</p>
                  <p>New features will be being added as we go,
                    and any suggestions are appreciated.</p>
                  <p>As myShopDash (or, rather, the browser extension) uses
                  a Woolworths' corporate program interface that is not
                  oficially documented, some issues might arise if modification
                  to the protocol are introduced by the company.
                  So if something looks broken, drop me a message.</p>
