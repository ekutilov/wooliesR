                <p>The Service has been created with no intention of collecting
                  personal data. That’s why it doesn’t ask for your name, e-mail,
                  address, phone number, login details, credit card, neither does
                  it collect those from your Everyday Rewards Account.</p>

                <h4><strong>i. Client-side (the Extension)</strong></h4>
                <p>The Extension runs when the user is logged in to their Everyday
                  Account. It downloads user’s shopping statements and eReceipts,
                  including dates, addresses of stores, items bought, the amount
                  paid, the number of the loyalty card presented, mode of payment,
                  four last digits of the number of the bank card used as payment,
                  collected/spent loyalty points. The Extension requests this data
                  from the program servers and stores it locally in the user’s browser.</p>
                <p>The User can choose to download this data onto their computer
                  directly from the browser. In this case, the data is not transferred
                  anywhere.</p>
                <h4><strong>ii. Server-side (the Website)</strong></h4>
                <p>The User can choose to upload data to the Website, which provides
                  convenient tools for analysing, decoding and reviewing the data.
                  In this case, the information will be stored in the Website data
                  storage for the duration of the user session.</p>
                <p>The data will be accessible only to the user that uploaded it
                  and only from their current browser. The user can choose to
                  delete the data from the server by pressing the ‘Delete data’
                  button. Otherwise, the user’s files are deleted no later than 36
                  hours of uploading into the service.</p>

                    in directly on the Everyday Reward site and run the Extension
                    within your genuine logged session. As such, the Service does not have
                    access and can not store your login and password.</p>
                  <p>The Service doesn’t query user’s personal information from the
                    Everyday Rewards API.</p>
